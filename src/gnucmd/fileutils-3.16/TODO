Tasks for GNU fileutils (listed in order of decreasing priority):

  unify textutils/fileutils/sh-utils
  libitize
  update copyright dates
  make help/version output conformant

  ls: test suite to exercize -l and -l --full-time with various LANG settings

  mv: move non-regular files between partitions.  This will probably
    involve factoring out and librarizing cp's copying code.

  ls: recognize --format="%a %b..." strftime formats
  ls: add new % formats to get the 10 bytes of the permissions string
    (both individually and as groups)

  cp, mv, ln, install: make --verbose report on backup files

  chmod, chown (maybe others): Don't strip slashes unless configure
      detects that e.g. lstat can't deal with them.

fix automake's
  rm -f $(libexec_PROGRAMS)
rule of clean-libexecPROGRAMS

  chown/chgrp/chmod: add new option: --reference=FILE see +utils/chown
