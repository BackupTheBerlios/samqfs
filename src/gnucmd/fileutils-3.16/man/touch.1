.SH DESCRIPTION
This documentation is no longer being maintained and may be inaccurate
or incomplete.  The Texinfo documentation is now the authoritative source.
.PP
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR touch .
.B touch
changes the access and modification times of each given file to the
current time.  Files that do not exist are created empty.
If the first file name given would be a valid argument to the
.I \-t
option and no timestamp is given with any of the
.IR \-d ,
.IR \-r ,
or
.I \-t
options and the
.I \-\-
argument is not given, that argument is interpreted as the time for
the other files instead of as a filename.
.PP
If changing both the access and modification times to the current
time,
.B touch
can change the timestamps for files that the user running it does not
own but has write permission for.  Otherwise, the user must own the
files.
