This version of MySQL, V5.0.51a, is available at:
Binaries: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#solaris
Source: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#source

If you wish to build SAM-QFS you will need to download the
MySQL binaries for your architecture or build MySQL from the
source package. 

To package MySQL for each architecture:
1. Download the package from the site specified above to 
   a directory outside the SAM-QFS source tree.  If using prebuilt
   binaries goto step 4.

2. If building from source set the CFLAGS environment variable to 
   the appropriate setting for your architecture (e.g. -xarch=i386)

3. Build the code according to the instructions found in the source
   package. There is no need to run make install as the resulting 
   binaries are what is needed.

4. Create the architecture specific directories in the SAM-QFS tree.
   At sam-qfs/src/lib/mysql/V5/5.0.51a create a directory for each
   architecture needed:
	i386/
	sparc/

   In each of these directories create 2 subdirectories:
	include/
	lib/

5. Copy the MySQL header files and client libraries to the 
   architecture specific directories in the SAM-QFS tree.
	
   For example: The i386 version should be copied from the download's 
   build_unix directory to: sam-qfs/src/lib/bdb/V4/4.4.20/i386/
   directory as follows:
   
	a. Copy the following header files from MySQL package to the 
	   i386/include directory.
			errmsg.h
			my_alloc.h
			my_list.h
			mysql_com.h
			mysql_time.h
			mysql_version.h
			mysql.h
			typelib.h
	
	b. Copy libmysqlclient.so and libmysqlclient_r.so to the
	   i386/lib directory
