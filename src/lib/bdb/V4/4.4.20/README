This version of Berkeley DB, V4.4.20 without encryption, was downloaded from:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/db/index.html

It has been patched with the publicly available patches as of
5/12/08. These include patches for: 14061, 14033, 14240, 14657

It was built with the 'standard' "configure" options.  All platform
libraries were built with the Solaris Sun Studio 10 C compiler with
CFLAGS set to the following:
  i386:		no additional cflags
  AMD64:	-xarch=amd64 -Ui386 -U__i386
  sparc:	no additional cflags
  sparcv9:	-xarch=v9 -xchip=ultra2

If you wish to build SAM-QFS on an i386 machine you will need to build
Berkeley DB for both i386 and AMD64. If you wish to build SAM-QFS on
a sparc machine you will need to build Berkeley DB for both sparc 
and sparcv9.

To build Berkeley DB for each architecture:
1. Download the source and patches from the site specified above to 
   a directory outside the SAM-QFS source tree.

2. Apply the patches to the source.

3. Set the CFLAGS environment variable to the appropriate setting
   from above.

4. Build the code according to the instructions found by following the
   'Building for UNIX/POSIX systems' link on the docs/index.html
   page found in the download. There is no need to run make install
   as the resulting binaries are what is needed.

5. Create the architecture specific directories in the SAM-QFS tree.
   At sam-qfs/src/lib/bdb/V4/4.4.20 create the following directories
	amd_64/
	i386/
	solaris_sparc/
	solaris_sparcv9/

   In each of these directories create 2 subdirectories:
	include/
	lib/

6. Copy the header file and libraries to the architecture specific
   directories in the SAM-QFS tree.
	
   For example: The i386 version should be copied from the download's 
   build_unix directory to: sam-qfs/src/lib/bdb/V4/4.4.20/i386/
   directory as follows:
	a. copy db.h to the i386/include directory
	b. copy libdb-4.4.a and libdb-4-4.so to the i386/lib directory
